# School Attendances Rates in Connecticut, 2019-2022

## Topic
Data was collected for public school attendance in Connecticut over the course of three school years from 2019-2022. In this project, analysis was performed to consider any trends or insights in attendance rates between different student groups and different school districts across connecticut. Questions considered include:

1. How does the attendance rate of each student group compare to the overall attendance rate of students in Connecticut over the course of these three years?
2. With the national average attendance rate today being approximately 90%, how does the data from Connecticut compare to this threshold?
3. How did attendance rates changes from year to year? Were their any observable differences for any particular student groups when the pandemic began in 2020?
4. In a given school distract, does the population of higher-need students correlate to a higher or lower attendance rate?

## Dataset
The primary dataset for this project can be found here. ​​This dataset includes the attendance rates for Connecticut public school students in grades PK-12. The data is grouped by student category as well as by school district. The data is from three school years: 2019-20, 2020-21, and 2021-22. The student groups that are in our dataset are listed below:

Students Grouped by Level of Need
- Students with high needs*
- Students without high needs

Students Grouped by Category of Need
- Students Experiencing Homelessness
- Students With Disabilities
- Free Meal Eligible
- Reduced Price Meal Eligible
- English Learners

Students Grouped by Race/Ethnicity
- Black or African American
- Hispanic/Latino of any race
- White
- All other races

Note: Students with high needs are defined in this study as students who: are English language learners; receive special eduction; and/or qualify for free or reduced lunch.

Additionally, this dataset provides locations and coordinates for schools within each school district, and was eventually merged with the primary dataset to match with Connecticut district names. One school was selected from each district to be used for representative coordinates for each district.

## Project Inspiration & Initial Design

Data Visualization #1 – Mapping attendance rates by school district and displaying a pop up on each with attendance statistics

Data Visualization #2 – Bar graph displaying attendance rates by student category compared to the average attendance rate for a student in America

Data Visualization #3 – Line graph showing changes in attendance rates over the three years of data collection in Connecticut, with a reference line on the graph showing when the covid pandemic began.
